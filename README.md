This repository provides an example of using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to model the Van Allen radiation belts by training on a variety of time-series data such as solar wind parameters (speed, density, dynamic pressure, and interplanetary magnetic field), the F10.7 index, and geomagnetic indices (Kp, Dst, SYM-H, AE, and AL) obtained from NASA OMNIweb at https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/, alongside RBSP MagEIS Level 4 data from https://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/data/rbsp/. The code demonstrates how to preprocess these datasets, train an LSTM model, and evaluate its performance in predicting variations in electron flux within the radiation belts.
